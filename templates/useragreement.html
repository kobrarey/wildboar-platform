b) acceptance of the application, if the USDT were received before acceptance.

6.4.17. Issuance after completion of Fund formation occurs provided payment USDT is not less than the minimum specified in the investment declaration. The maximum amount of each subsequent contribution is not limited.

6.4.18. Procedure for transferring USDT as payment:

6.4.20. After completion of Fund formation, return of USDT in cases provided by the investment declaration is performed within five (5) business days from when the Management Company knew or should have known that USDT cannot be included, except for a specific case provided by the investment declaration.

During Fund formation:
— if USDT is received before an acquisition application is submitted, and no application is accepted within 30 days of receipt, USDT is returned within seven (7) days after that period to the account from which USDT was transferred;
— if payment is made after an application is submitted but the payment order lacks buyer details or the registered email, and within three (3) days from receipt the payer does not submit a clarifying statement, units are not issued and USDT is returned within seven (7) days after that period;
— if the amount received is insufficient to issue units and within three (3) days additional USDT is not received to reach sufficiency, units are not issued and USDT is returned within seven (7) days after that period.

6.4.21. After completion of Fund formation, return of USDT is performed to the account specified in the acquisition application. If return to that account is impossible, return is not performed within 30 business days from the date of provision of the relevant funds.

7.2. Account security

You assume full responsibility for loss of Digital Assets stored or transferred from your non-custodial wallet or a wallet managed by a centralized intermediary, including unauthorized access, loss/compromise of passwords or private keys, errors due to transfers to/from incorrect public keys or addresses, or mismatch between distributed ledger networks of sender and recipient (“Blockchain mismatch”). If Digital Assets are lost due to blockchain mismatch when transferring to your account, Wild boar is not liable and does not undertake actions to recover such assets; you acknowledge such assets are not recoverable by Wild boar.

7.5. Acquisition of Unit(s)

If acquiring Unit(s) via a non-custodial wallet, the User signs a smart contract to execute the transfer transaction. After execution, Wild boar displays an online web-page notice of smart contract execution. From execution, within three (3) business days your funds will be allocated and the corresponding number of Fund units will be credited. The User receives email notice of the acquisition execution.

If acquiring via a centralized intermediary, the user must contact the operator in chat and provide information including: the Fund name, the amount in USDT for acquisition, and the email used at registration; then execute a transaction to the address provided by the chat operator. After blockchain confirmation, the user receives notification from the operator. From execution, within three (3) business days funds will be allocated and units credited; email notice is sent.

If acquiring on a date other than the first week of the calendar month, the user must pay the Management Company an acquisition surcharge of 1.5% of the value of one Fund unit.

Redemption (payout) via Personal Account:
When submitting a redemption request using a non-custodial wallet, the User receives notice of receipt of the request for the specified number of units; if the number exceeds the actual units owned, the request reflects the maximum available units. The request is executed within three (3) business days; funds are transferred in full to the user’s non-custodial wallet specified at registration; email notice is sent.

When submitting a redemption request using a wallet address belonging to a centralized intermediary, the user specifies the wallet address to receive an amount equal to the value of the redeemed units; similar rules apply for exceeding unit quantity; execution within three (3) business days; funds transferred to the specified address; email notice is sent.

If redemption is requested on a date other than the first week of the calendar month or earlier than six (6) calendar months from the acquisition date, the user must pay the Management Company a redemption discount/fee of 3% of the value of one Fund unit.

We are not responsible for any distributed ledger network fees (“gas”) that may apply to your redemption request or transfers. You acknowledge we may not be able to execute redemption immediately. While we will use best efforts to execute in reasonable time, we provide no guarantee regarding processing time and are not liable for damages due to delay.

7.6. Account history

A historical record of transactions (“Transaction History”) may be available in your account. You acknowledge that Transaction History is not considered an appraisal/valuation of your account. We use reasonable efforts to ensure the information is accurate, but errors may occur; such errors do not affect actual funds and results. You are solely responsible for reviewing Transaction History and notices.

Any transaction listed in Transaction History or other message (including orders, trades, receipts emailed to you) is deemed authorized, correct, approved, and confirmed by you unless we receive written notice to the contrary within three (3) business days from listing/sending (as applicable).

10. RISK DISCLOSURE

Trading Digital Assets, derivatives, units of unit investment funds, and other financial assets is risky, and you should never trade more than you can afford to lose. The following list of risks related to such assets and the Services is not exhaustive. Please review the Risk Warning for additional information.

a) Prices of Digital Assets are highly volatile; trading is extremely risky. Liquidity may be affected by regulatory activity, market manipulation, issuer actions/inaction, or unexplained volatility. By using the Services, you assume the risk of trading Digital Assets and derivatives.

By entering any transaction, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for your own independent risk assessment of the transaction and the underlying Digital Asset.

b) We do not provide advice on any specific Digital Assets, derivatives, Digital Asset Exchanges, units of unit investment funds, or other financial assets. We do not provide advice on transactions or related risks, or investment or legal advice in connection with the Services. If we provide trading data, publish market commentary, articles, or social media posts, this is incidental to your relationship with us and must not be considered investment/financial advice.

PURCHASING OR SELLING DIGITAL ASSETS AND/OR DERIVATIVES, UNITS OF UNIT INVESTMENT FUNDS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS IS EXCLUSIVELY THE USER’S DECISION, AND WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES.

c) No brokerage intermediation or investment advice. We provide asset management within the investment declarations of the fund units. Our relationship is not a broker-client relationship.

d) Wild boar expressly states it does not guarantee profit or repetition of profit ratios achieved in the past and warns that no positive report on a trading strategy guarantees repetition of trading success in the future.

e) The fund manager may breach obligations to manage in the Users’ best interests in ways unknown to us; funds invested may be lost.

f) The User bears financial responsibility for any losses incurred in the Account due to trading activities of the fund managers.

g) The User assumes full responsibility for financial losses (including direct losses or loss of profit) arising from risks including: lack of manager qualifications/knowledge; fraudulent operations; loss of control over the Account allowing third-party access; misunderstanding/misinterpretation of the Terms; closure of Wild boar’s account.

h) We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted, or secure access to any part of the Services; operation may be disrupted by many factors beyond our control, including regulatory reasons and problems with blockchain networks.

i) Although Wild boar conducts due diligence on exchanges it interacts with, exchanges may be unregulated and practices may vary widely, including security, encryption, and liability for losses. Exchanges may not follow rules on pricing, insider trading, price discovery, loss insurance, fraud protection, AML compliance, and other important functions; may be fraudulent fronts; and may be located in jurisdictions where recovery is unlikely. Exchanges may provide incorrect/delayed/erroneous data due to software errors and limited oversight; such data may mislead trading strategies or distort price discovery mechanisms. Errors, fraud, and other exchange problems have repeatedly caused significant irrecoverable losses; exchange software/mechanisms may fail and execute trades at erroneous prices; exchanges may cancel trades in others’ interests to the detriment of fund managers; and non-reviewable decisions may negatively affect investment value.

11. LIQUIDATION OF ACCOUNTS AND PAYMENT OF DEFICIT BALANCE

In the event of:
a) death or a court decision declaring the User incapable (incompetent);
b) filing for bankruptcy;
c) failure to provide any information requested under these Terms or applicable law;
d) abusive trading practices, manipulation, and/or fraud by the User or any person authorized to use the account; or
e) any other circumstances/events that we deem appropriate to protect Wild boar and/or the User at Wild boar’s sole discretion,
Wild boar reserves the right to perform any obligation imposed by the User, directly or as guarantor/surety, from any User funds certified by units of unit investment funds. This action may be taken without prior notice of sale/purchase or other notice to the User or their representatives/heirs/executors/administrators/trustees/successors, regardless of whether ownership is sole or joint.

12. LIABILITY

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Wild boar from any liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by Wild boar arising from the User’s failure to timely and fully perform obligations under this Agreement or any third-party license, or if any User representations and warranties are not true and correct.

You also agree to promptly pay Wild boar all losses and costs, including attorneys’ fees, incurred due to non-performance of any provisions of these Terms and any other agreements between Wild boar and the User.

In addition to liability limitations in other sections, Wild boar is not liable and is released from all claims and losses if the claim/loss was caused by:
a) the User’s act or omission;
b) any act/omission of any person accessing the User’s account, whether authorized by the User or not;
c) system malfunction, equipment failure (User or Wild boar), system interruption or unavailability;
d) delays, failures, or errors in executing any instruction;
e) inaccurate or incomplete instructions received from the User;
f) any use by the User or any other third party with account access of any financial/market data, quotes, news, analyst opinions, research reports, charts, or other data/information available through the trading platform or any third-party license, whether to complete a transaction or for any other purpose.

13. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES / LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

If you are dissatisfied with any part of the Services or this Agreement, your sole and exclusive remedy is to stop using the Services and close your Account. The Services are provided “AS IS” without any express or implied warranties. Wild boar entities disclaim implied warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

Wild boar entities make no warranty that: (I) the Services will meet your requirements; (II) the Services will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; or (III) the quality, suitability, and performance of any Digital Assets, derivatives, units, Services, information, or other materials acquired or obtained by you will meet your expectations. Services are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties. Some jurisdictions do not allow exclusion/limitation of incidental or consequential damages; therefore, the above limitation may not apply to you.

14. NO WAIVER

From time to time, Wild boar may not require or strictly enforce compliance with any provision of these Terms and may not exercise any or all rights herein. Such non-enforcement must not be construed as a full waiver or relinquishment of Wild boar’s right to enforce or rely on any provision/right in this or any other instance.

If applicable, an express waiver granted by Wild boar of any term/condition/requirement is not a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such term/condition/requirement.

Вы признаете, понимаете и соглашаетесь с тем, что мы не сможем немедленно выполнить любой запрос на погашение паев паевых инвестиционных фондов. Хотя мы приложим все усилия для выполнения запроса на погашение паев паевых инвестиционных фондов в разумные сроки, мы не берем на себя никаких обязательств или гарантий в отношении времени обработки для выполнения запроса на погашение паев паевых инвестиционных фондов.

Вы признаете, понимаете и соглашаетесь с тем, что история учетной записи не будет рассматриваться как оценка вашей учетной записи. Мы прилагаем разумные усилия для обеспечения того, чтобы информация, содержащаяся в истории вашей учетной записи и любых уведомлениях, которые предоставляет вам Wild boar, были точными и надежными; однако время от времени могут возникать ошибки, и такие ошибки не влияют на фактические средства и результаты данной транзакции. Вы несете единоличную ответственность за просмотр истории вашей учетной записи и любых уведомлений. Любая транзакция, указанная в истории вашего счета, или другое сообщение, включая, помимо прочего, заказы, сделки или другие квитанции, отправленные на вашу электронную почту, считается и рассматривается как санкционированная, правильная, утвержденная и подтвержденная вами, если мы не получим письменного уведомления об обратном в течение трех (3) рабочих дней с даты, когда транзакция была указана или сообщение было отправлено (в зависимости от случая).

10. РАСКРЫТИЕ ИНФОРМАЦИИ О РИСКАХ

Торговля цифровыми активами, производными цифровыми, паями паевых инвестиционных фондов и другими финансовыми активами является рискованной, и вы никогда не должны торговать больше, чем можете позволить себе потерять. Следующий список рисков, связанных с цифровыми активами, производными цифровыми активами, паями паевых инвестиционных фондов и другими финансовыми активами а также услугами не является исчерпывающим. Пожалуйста, ознакомьтесь с Предупреждением о рисках для получения дополнительной информации.

а) Цены на цифровые активы очень волатильны, а торговля цифровыми активами чрезвычайно рискованна. Кроме того, несколько факторов могут повлиять на рыночную ликвидность конкретного цифрового актива, таких как нормативная деятельность, манипуляции с рынком, действия или бездействие эмитента цифрового актива или необъяснимая волатильность цен. Используя Услуги, вы принимаете на себя риск торговли цифровыми активами и производными цифровыми активами. Заключая любую сделку, вы заявляете, что были, есть и будете нести единоличную ответственность за проведение собственной независимой оценки рисков сделки и базового цифрового актива.
b) Мы не консультируем по существу каких-либо конкретных цифровых активов, производных цифровых активов, бирж цифровых активов, паев паевых инвестиционных фондов и других финансовых активов. Мы не консультируем по сделкам или связанным с ними рискам, инвестиционные или юридические консультации в связи с Услугами. В той мере, в какой мы предоставляем торговые данные, публикуем рыночные комментарии, статьи или делаем посты в социальных сетях, это является случайным для ваших отношений с нами, и такая информация не может рассматриваться как инвестиционный или финансовый совет и не должна толковаться как таковая. ПОКУПКА ИЛИ ПРОДАЖА ЦИФРОВЫХ АКТИВОВ И/ИЛИ ЦИФРОВЫХ АКТИВОВ, ПРОИЗВОДНЫХ, ПАЕВ ПАЕВЫХ ИНВЕСТИЦИОННЫХ ФОНДОВ И ДРУГИХ ФИНАНСОВЫХ АКТИВОВ ЯВЛЯЕТСЯ ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО РЕШЕНИЕМ ПОЛЬЗОВАТЕЛЯ, И МЫ НЕ НЕСЕМ ОТВЕТСТВЕННОСТИ ЗА КАКИЕ-ЛИБО ПОСЛЕДОВАТЕЛЬНЫЕ УБЫТКИ.
c) Никакого брокерского посредничества в сделках или предоставления инвестиционных консультаций. Мы предоставляем управление активами пользователей в рамках инвестиционных деклараций паевых инвестиционных паев. Наши отношения не представляют собой отношения между брокером и клиентами.
d) Wild boar прямо заявляет Пользователю, что он не гарантирует прибыль или повторение коэффициентов прибыли, которые были сделаны в прошлом, и предупреждает, что ни один положительный отчет о реализации торговой стратегии не гарантирует повторение торгового успеха в будущем.
e) Менеджер фонда может нарушить обязательство по управлению паевыми инвестиционными фондами в отношении наилучших интересов Пользователей, о которых у нас может не быть информации, так что средства, вложенные в паевые инвестиционные фонды, могут быть потеряны.
f) Пользователь несет финансовую ответственность за любые убытки, понесенные на Счете в результате торговой деятельности менеджеров паевых инвестиционных фондов.
g) Пользователь принимает на себя полную ответственность за любые финансовые убытки, такие как прямые убытки или убытки от прибыли, возникшие в результате следующих рисков: i) риск того, что менеджеры паевых инвестиционных фондов не обладает необходимой квалификацией или знаниями, необходимыми для осуществления торговой деятельности; ii) риск того, что менеджеры паевых инвестиционных фондов могут проводить мошеннические операции; iii) риск того, что менеджеры паевых инвестиционных фондов, могут потерять контроль над Счетом, а третьи лица могут получить доступ к Счету; iv) риск того, что Пользователь может неправильно понять или неправильно истолковать настоящие Условия; v) риск закрытия учетной записи компании Wild boar.
h) Мы не гарантируем непрерывный, непрерывный или безопасный доступ к любой части Услуг, а работа нашего Веб-сайта или Услуг может быть нарушена многочисленными факторами, находящими из нашего контроля, включая нормативные причины и проблемы с различными блокчейн-сетями.
i) Хотя Wild boar прилагает все усилия для проведения комплексной проверки бирж цифровых активов, c которыми осуществляется взаимодействие компании Wild boar, эти биржи цифровых активов могут быть нерегулируемыми биржами, и их практика может сильно различаться, в том числе в отношении их безопасности, шифрования и ответственности за убытки. Обмены цифровыми активами не должны соблюдать какие-либо правила, касающиеся прайдинга, инсайдерской торговли, продвижения обнаружения цен, застрахование убытков, защиты от мошенничества, обеспечения соблюдения требований по борьбе с отмыванием денег и многих других важных функций. Биржи цифровых активов могут осуществлять мошеннические операции или фронты для мошеннических схем и находятся в юрисдикции, где нет вероятности взыскания или возмещения. Обмен цифровыми активами могут предоставлять неправильные, отложенные или иные ошибочные данные по целому ряду причин, в том числе в результате ошибок программного обеспечения и вышеупомянутого ограниченного надзора на рынках криптовалют. Такие плохие данные могут дезинформировать торговые стратегии менеджеров паевых инвестиционных фондов или привести к неточным механизмам обнаружения цен. Ошибки, мошенничество и другие проблемы с биржами цифровых активов неоднократно приводились к значительным, невозвратным потерям в недавнем прошлом. Базовое программное обеспечение и механизмы для бирж цифровых активов могут выйти из строя, выполняя сделки для менеджеров паевых инвестиционных фондов по ошибочным ценам и негативно влияя на инвестиции менеджеров паевых инвестиционных фондов. Биржи цифровых активов могут отказаться от сделок в интересах других сторон, но в ущерб менеджеров паевых инвестиционных фондов. В целом, ошибки и не подлежащие пересмотру решения бирж могут негативно повлиять на стоимость инвестиций менеджеров паевых инвестиционных фондов.

11. ЛИКВИДАЦИЯ СЧЕТОВ И ВЫПЛАТА ОСТАТКА ДЕФИЦИТА

В случае:

а) смерть или судебное решение о признании недееспособным (некомпетентным) Пользователя;
b) подача ходатайства о банкротстве;
c) непредставление Пользователем любой информации, запрашиваемой в соответствии с настоящими Условиями или любым применимым законодательством;
d) любое злоупотребление торговой практикой, манипуляции и/или мошенничество со стороны Пользователя или любого другого лица, уполномоченного использовать учетную запись; или
e) любые другие обстоятельства или события, которые мы сочтем целесообразными для защиты Wild boar и/или Пользователя, собственному усмотрению Wild boar,

Wild boar оставляет за собой право выполнить любое обязательство, которое может быть возложено Пользователем, либо напрямую, либо в порядке гарантии поручительства, из любых средств Пользователя, удостоверяемых паями паевых инвестиционных фондов. Это действие может быть предпринято без предварительного уведомления о продаже или покупке или иного уведомления Пользователю, личным представителям, наследникам, исполнителям, администраторам, попечителям, законом или правопреемникам, независимо от того, принадлежит ли доля в праве собственности исключительно Пользователю или принадлежит совместно с другими.

12. ОТВЕТСТВЕННОСТЬ

Вы также соглашаетесь незамедлительно выплатить Wild boar все убытки, издержки, включая гонорары адвокатов, понесенные в связи с не исполнением любого из положений настоящих Условий и любых других соглашений между Wild boar и Пользователем. В дополнение к любым ограничениям ответственности, указанным в других разделах настоящих Условий, Wild Boar не несет ответственности и освобождается от всех претензий и убытков, понесенных, в связи с этим, если претензия или убытки были вызваны:

a) Действием или бездействием со стороны Пользователя;
b) Любое действие или бездействие любого лица, получающего доступ к учетной записи Пользователя, независимо от того, санкционировал ли Пользователь такой доступ или нет;
